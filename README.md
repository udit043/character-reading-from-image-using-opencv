# character-reading-from-image-using-opencv
While using gocr and tesseract , i don't know what is happening inside the process of extracting characters. I am very new to opencv and using C interface. And with very little knowledge i started to make character reading from image. Yes it seriously needs lot of modification and improvment that's why i uploaded my project here. This is just starting of project. Any help/suggestions are welcomed.. :)
